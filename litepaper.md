****
Privacy is at the core of the blockchain ecosystem and at the center of the original ideals of the Cypherpunks. However, today with the growing number of blockchain applications in our ecosystem with use cases increasingly connected to the rest of the world (apartment rental, tokenization of real-world assets, DID...), it is becoming increasingly difficult to detach one's on-chain identity from one's own identity.

  

## **1.  Executive Summary**
    
XRPL Solvency is a solution that addresses the growing need for privacy in the blockchain ecosystem by providing a means for individuals to prove solvency without revealing their wallet address or transaction history. This is achieved through the use of cryptographic ring signature technology and other cryptographic means to generate verifiable, solvency proofs at a specific point in time. The solution is designed for individuals who value their privacy while transacting on blockchain platforms, and it offers a unique value proposition by allowing users to prove solvency without compromising their privacy.

  

## **2.  The problem**
    
The XRP Ledger is a decentralized, open-source blockchain technology that enables fast and secure transactions of the digital currency XRP. While the XRP Ledger provides a reliable platform for sending and receiving XRP, there is currently a need for solutions specifically designed for generating solvency proofs. This gap in the market creates an opportunity for solutions like the XRPL Solvency project to offer a new, innovative approach to generating proof of solvency that provides greater privacy and security for users. By leveraging cryptographic ring signatures and other cryptographic means, XRPL Solvency can generate verifiable solvency proofs that do not reveal the user's on-chain assets and history associated with their own identity, filling a need that is currently unmet by XRP Ledger-based solutions. XRPL Solvency could be used to offer a new level of trust and transparency to the XRP ecosystem, while ensuring the privacy and security of users' on-chain assets.

SECP256k1 is a widely used elliptic curve cryptography algorithm that is used in many blockchain applications, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. While SECP256K1 provides a secure means of generating cryptographic signatures and keys, it is not ideally suited for use in zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) such as ZK-SNARKs.

ZK-SNARKs require pairing-friendly elliptic curve cryptography, which is not a property of SECP256K1. This means that implementing ZK-SNARKs with SECP256K1 is not straightforward and requires additional workarounds that can significantly reduce the efficiency and security of the system.

As XRPL Solvency is designed to provide a highly secure and efficient means of generating verifiable solvency proofs, the team behind the project needs to carefully consider the cryptography algorithms used in the solution. While SECP256K1 is a widely used and secure algorithm, it is not ideally suited for ZK-SNARKs, and other cryptography algorithms may need to be considered to ensure the best possible security and efficiency for the solution.

## **3.  The solution**  

Our solution stands in 2 words : Ring Signatures. Ring signatures are a type of digital signature that allows a member of a group to sign a message on behalf of the group without revealing which member actually signed the message. In other words, a ring signature makes it impossible to determine who exactly in the group signed the message, while still proving that someone in the group did sign it.

The name "ring signature" comes from the way the signature is created. It involves a "ring" of public keys belonging to group members, and the signature is formed by combining the signer's private key with the public keys of other members in the ring. The result is a signature that can be verified by anyone using the group's public keys, but cannot be traced back to the individual who actually signed it.

Ring signatures have a variety of applications, including enhancing privacy in blockchain transactions. They are often used in privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Monero to obscure the sender's identity and make transactions unlinkable.

Ring signatures are considered to be XRPL and EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) friendly because they are based on elliptic curve cryptography. In addition, ring signatures do not require any special hardware or software to run, as they can be implemented using smart contracts on any blockchain.

Moreover, ring signatures are a proven and well-established cryptographic technique that has been widely used in the cryptocurrency industry, particularly for privacy-focused applications. The underlying math is well-understood, and implementations of ring signatures have been tested and reviewed by the cryptography community, providing a high level of confidence in their security.

Ring signatures are also highly efficient, allowing for fast and scalable computation of cryptographic signatures, which is important in the context of blockchain applications where speed and scalability are critical. As a result, ring signatures are a good choice for applications that require fast and secure cryptographic operations, such as XRPL Solvency  proof generation.

Overall, the use of ring signatures in XRPL Solvency makes it an efficient and secure solution for generating verifiable solvency proofs on the XRPL lockchain.

Ring signatures are considered scalable because they can be verified quickly and efficiently, even when the size of the signing group is very large. This is because the verification process only involves checking a single signature, rather than verifying multiple signatures from each member of the group.

When a signature is generated using a ring signature scheme, it includes information about the entire group of public keys, but does not reveal which specific key was used to create the signature. This means that anyone can verify the signature by checking that it was produced using one of the public keys in the group, without having to perform additional computations to verify each individual key in the group.

This makes ring signatures particularly useful in applications that require fast and efficient signature verification, such as in the context of blockchain transactions, where multiple signatures may need to be verified in a short period of time. Additionally, the fact that ring signatures are scalable makes them well-suited to use in decentralized systems, where a large number of participants may need to sign and verify messages on a regular basis.

**Proof of reserve**
Current PoRs are carried out by independent entities.
With our solution anyone can generate a PoR via an open source and verifiable mechanism based on cryptographic concepts.
This concept will be more developed in the future for institutions. 

  
## **4.  How it works**  

**Step 1 :** Generating the solvency proof

![](https://i.postimg.cc/T1tBds6X/tuto.png)  

Alice wants to generate a solvency proof for Bob :

1.  Alice visits our website
    
2.  She follows the easy steps
    
3.  She uses our Solvency proof generation program by downloading it
    
4.  If her proof is valid, Alice will receive a SoulBound Token (NFT) on her communication address as a proof of her solvability
    
5.  The SoulBoundToken can now be shown to anyone
  

**Step 2 :** Agreement

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hiCF517BlU-vz-x1TLLvdIAQRkGX_Mojwv5e9eRMGatGlrNOz27U61-seWmNmV6kAlRBkoLkBMkkxO3fh5i_8fOeNZGLR8ytozUsIX-v_oljPGb3cNQ-AvoyizLHMWzzjsakYQm4aBj9cRBXBptVNMY)

Bob want to verify Aliceâ€™s proof :

1.  Bob goes to XRPL Solvency's Dapp, in the check proof section
    
2.  He fills in Alice's communication address as well as the ID of the SoulBound token given by Alice
    
3.  If a corresponding SoulBound token owned by Alice exists, it will be displayed with all the revelants informations
    
4.  Bob verify all the infos that he need to know


**Step 3 :** Transfering the funds
Once an agreement has been reached between Alice and Bob, Alice can send the various funds directly to Bob. But to increase his privacy, he will have to use a different wallet than the one linked to the generation of the proof of solvency.
